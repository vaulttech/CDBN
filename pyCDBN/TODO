TODO
====

* Undertand what `crbm_whiten()` does.

* Test `crbm_blocksum2D()`

* Create a decent README.md

* Generate decent demo.py with code that actually does something

* Make cuCRBM more "usable" (I don't want to have install it by hand for myself)


TODO in the far future
----------------------

* When supporting `same` convolutions, change `mod_1` and `mod_2` calculations
  in `preprocess_train_data2D()` (need to not take into account the size of the
  filter)

* Add support for initializing the weights with passed values (just look at my
  code that does that).
	* Adjust `Model` class to receive the parameters
	* Adjust `crbm2D()` to receive them too
	* Adjust `cdbn2D()` to receive them too

* Refactor `apply_gradient2D()`
